------------
KNOWN ISSUES
------------
The following are known issues with the Microsoft JDBC Driver 6.2 for SQL Server:

1) PARAMETER METADATA LIMITATIONS WHEN USING SQL SERVER 2008 OR 2008 R2

1.a) PreparedStatement.getParameterMetadata() throws an SQLException when used
with a parametrized MERGE query
1.b) Parameter metadata for prepared statements does not work with queries having subqueries/joins.


2) JavaKerberos and IBM VMs

If you are running under Windows environments and using either keytab or kerberos ticket to connect, you may have to specify the principalname in the configuration file to get the Java Kerberos working. For example: 
SQLJDBCDriver {
  com.ibm.security.auth.module.Krb5LoginModule required
  seDefaultCcache=true
  credsType=initiator
  principal=principalname@principaldomain;
};


3) CONNECTION DROPPING WITH SQL AZURE

When connecting to SQL Azure, idle connections may be terminated by a network component (such as a 
firewall) after a period of inactivity. To avoid dropping idle connections by a network component, 
the following registry settings (or their non-Windows equivalents) should be set on the operating 
system where the driver is loaded:
           
Registry Setting                                                                   Recommended value
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters\KeepAliveTime            30000
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters\KeepAliveInterval         1000
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters\TcpMaxDataRetransmission  10
